# Bootstrap-Portfolio
Bootstrap-Project

This Portfolio has been created using Bootstrap CSS.

the idea behind this homework project is to create an easy aplication using bootstrap templates 
to somwhat match the Basic Portfolio initially created for the first assignment.

Bootstrap is a free and open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end web development.
It contains CSS- and JavaScript-based (there hasn't been any Java script on my project) design templates for typography, 
forms, buttons, navigation and other interface components.


This project has been deployed to git hub pages
